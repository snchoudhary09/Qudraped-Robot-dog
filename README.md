# Qudraped-Robot-dog
<h3>Design and Simulation of Quadruped Robot leg</h3>
Software used: SOLIDWORKS 

<h2>Summary</h2>
The goal of this project is to create a four-legged robot and simulate motion with it. Important assemblies like gears and power transmissions require design effort. The experiment focuses on the movement of quadrupeds' legs in different environments, such as sand and solid surfaces.
